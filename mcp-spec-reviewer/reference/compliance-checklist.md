# MCP Compliance Checklist

**Spec revision**: 2025-11-25
All requirements extracted from the official specification.

Legend: 🔴 MUST | 🟡 SHOULD | 🟢 MAY

---

## Base Protocol

### JSON-RPC
- 🔴 All messages MUST be UTF-8 encoded JSON-RPC 2.0
- 🔴 Request IDs MUST be string or integer, MUST NOT be null
- 🔴 Implementations MUST support JSON Schema 2020-12 for schemas without explicit `$schema`
- 🔴 MUST handle unsupported schema dialects gracefully with appropriate error

### _meta
- 🟢 Requests, notifications, results MAY include `_meta` for protocol metadata

---

## Lifecycle

### Initialization
- 🔴 Initialization MUST be the first interaction between client and server
- 🔴 Client MUST send `initialize` request with protocolVersion, capabilities, clientInfo
- 🔴 Server MUST respond with protocolVersion, capabilities, serverInfo
- 🔴 Client MUST send `notifications/initialized` after receiving server response
- 🟡 Client SHOULD NOT send requests (except ping) before server response
- 🟡 Server SHOULD NOT send requests (except ping, logging) before `initialized`

### Version Negotiation
- 🔴 Client MUST send protocol version in initialize
- 🟡 Client SHOULD send latest supported version
- 🔴 Server MUST respond with same version if supported, or another supported version
- 🟡 Server SHOULD respond with latest supported if client's version unsupported
- 🟡 Client SHOULD disconnect if it doesn't support server's version
- 🟡 Server SHOULD implement version auto-detection (echo client's version)

### Capability Negotiation
- 🔴 Both parties MUST respect negotiated protocol version during operation
- 🔴 Both parties MUST only use successfully negotiated capabilities

### Shutdown
- 🟡 Client SHOULD close stdin, wait, SIGTERM, then SIGKILL (stdio)
- 🟢 Server MAY initiate shutdown by closing stdout (stdio)

### Timeouts
- 🟡 SHOULD establish timeouts for all sent requests
- 🟡 On timeout: SHOULD send cancellation notification
- 🟡 SDKs SHOULD allow per-request timeout configuration
- 🟢 MAY reset timeout on progress notifications
- 🟡 SHOULD enforce maximum timeout regardless of progress

---

## Transports

### stdio
- 🔴 Messages MUST NOT contain embedded newlines
- 🟢 Server MAY write to stderr for logging
- 🟡 Client SHOULD NOT assume stderr = error
- 🔴 Server MUST NOT write non-MCP to stdout
- 🔴 Client MUST NOT write non-MCP to server stdin

### Streamable HTTP — Security
- 🔴 Servers MUST validate Origin header on all connections
- 🔴 Invalid Origin → MUST respond 403 Forbidden
- 🟡 Local servers SHOULD bind to localhost only
- 🟡 Servers SHOULD implement proper authentication

### Streamable HTTP — POST
- 🔴 Client MUST use POST for sending messages
- 🔴 Client MUST include Accept with `application/json` and `text/event-stream`
- 🔴 POST body MUST be single JSON-RPC message
- 🔴 Notification/response accepted → MUST return 202 Accepted
- 🔴 Notification/response rejected → MUST return HTTP error
- 🔴 Request → MUST return `application/json` or `text/event-stream`
- 🔴 Client MUST support both content types

### Streamable HTTP — GET
- 🟢 Client MAY issue GET for SSE stream
- 🔴 Client MUST include Accept with `text/event-stream`
- 🔴 Server MUST return `text/event-stream` or 405
- 🔴 Server MUST NOT send response on GET stream (unless resuming)

### Streamable HTTP — SSE
- 🟡 Server SHOULD prime with event ID + empty data
- 🟢 Server MAY close connection without terminating stream
- 🟡 Server SHOULD send `retry` before closing early
- 🔴 Client MUST respect `retry` timing
- 🟡 Stream SHOULD eventually include response
- 🟡 After response: server SHOULD terminate stream
- 🟡 Disconnection SHOULD NOT be interpreted as cancellation

### Session Management
- 🟢 Server MAY assign session ID via `MCP-Session-Id` header
- 🟡 Session ID SHOULD be globally unique, cryptographically secure
- 🔴 Session ID MUST contain only visible ASCII (0x21-0x7E)
- 🔴 Client MUST handle session ID securely
- 🔴 Client MUST include session ID on all subsequent requests (if assigned)
- 🟡 Server SHOULD respond 400 to requests without session ID (when required)
- 🔴 Terminated session → MUST respond 404
- 🔴 Client receiving 404 MUST start new session
- 🟡 Client SHOULD send DELETE to end session

### Protocol Version Header
- 🔴 Client MUST include `MCP-Protocol-Version` on all HTTP requests
- 🟡 Missing header: server SHOULD assume 2025-03-26
- 🔴 Invalid version: MUST respond 400

### Multiple Connections
- 🔴 Server MUST send each message on only one stream (no broadcast)

### Resumability
- 🔴 SSE event IDs MUST be globally unique within session (if used)
- 🟡 Event IDs SHOULD encode stream identity
- 🔴 Server MUST NOT replay messages from different stream

---

## Tools

### Declaration
- 🔴 Servers with tools MUST declare `tools` capability

### Tool Definition
- 🟡 Names SHOULD be 1-128 chars, case-sensitive
- 🟡 Names SHOULD use only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, `_`, `-`, `.`
- 🟡 Names SHOULD NOT contain spaces/commas/special chars
- 🟡 Names SHOULD be unique within server
- 🔴 `inputSchema` MUST be valid JSON Schema (not null)
- 🔴 If `outputSchema` provided: server MUST return conformant `structuredContent`
- 🟡 Clients SHOULD validate `structuredContent` against `outputSchema`

### Tool Annotations
- 🔴 Clients MUST consider annotations untrusted (unless from trusted server)

### Tool Results
- 🟡 Structured content: SHOULD also include serialized JSON in TextContent for backwards compat

### Error Handling
- 🟡 Input validation errors → Tool Execution Error (isError: true), NOT protocol error
- 🟡 Clients SHOULD provide tool execution errors to LLMs
- 🟢 Clients MAY provide protocol errors to LLMs

### Security
- 🔴 Servers MUST validate all tool inputs
- 🔴 Servers MUST implement access controls
- 🔴 Servers MUST rate limit tool invocations
- 🔴 Servers MUST sanitize tool outputs
- 🟡 Clients SHOULD prompt user confirmation on sensitive operations
- 🟡 Clients SHOULD show inputs before calling server
- 🟡 Clients SHOULD validate results before passing to LLM
- 🟡 Clients SHOULD implement timeouts
- 🟡 Clients SHOULD log usage for audit

### List Changed
- 🟡 If `listChanged` declared: SHOULD send `notifications/tools/list_changed`

---

## Resources

### Declaration
- 🔴 Servers with resources MUST declare `resources` capability

### URI Schemes
- 🟡 `https://` SHOULD only be used when client can fetch directly
- 🟡 SHOULD prefer non-https schemes when client reads via MCP

---

## Prompts

### Declaration
- 🔴 Servers with prompts MUST declare `prompts` capability

### Errors
- 🟡 SHOULD return standard JSON-RPC errors for failures

---

## Client Features

### Elicitation
- 🔴 Clients declaring elicitation MUST support at least one mode (form or url)
- 🔴 Servers MUST NOT send modes unsupported by client
- 🔴 URL mode: `url` parameter MUST contain valid URL

### Sampling
- 🔴 Users MUST explicitly approve sampling requests

---

## Utilities

### Ping
- 🔴 Receiver MUST respond promptly to ping

### Tasks (Experimental)
- 🔴 Task IDs MUST be unique within session
- 🔴 Receivers MUST generate task IDs
- 🔴 MUST NOT create tasks unless requestor includes `_meta.task.create`
- 🔴 Task access MUST be restricted to creating session
- 🔴 `tasks/result` MUST return what original request would have returned
- 🟡 Requestors SHOULD respect `pollInterval`
- 🟡 SHOULD continue polling until terminal status

### Pagination
- 🔴 Cursors are opaque — clients MUST NOT interpret them

---

## Security & Trust

### General Principles
- 🟡 SHOULD always have human in the loop for tool invocations
- 🟡 Hosts MUST obtain explicit user consent before exposing data to servers
- 🟡 Hosts MUST NOT transmit resource data elsewhere without consent

### Icons
- 🟢 Consumers MAY disallow specific file types
- 🟡 SHOULD validate MIME via magic bytes
- 🟡 SHOULD maintain strict allowlist of image types
